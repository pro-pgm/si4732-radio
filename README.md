# SI4732 Radio

SI4732 Radio is a custom firmware project designed to power my home-built radio receiver.

Based on [G8PTN's ATS_MINI](https://github.com/G8PTN/ATS_MINI).

## Overview

It harnesses the capabilities of the SI4732 module to deliver high-quality FM radio performance, while the innovative design optimizes simple hardware into a complete and versatile receiver platform.
